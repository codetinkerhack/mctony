# Control Windows 10 Minecraft with python!

This is a place to get a small Python file that will let you write code that will control Minecraft (Windows 10 version not Java).

There are other ways to control Minecraft with code. See here: https://minecraft.makecode.com

## To get started
Download and run Minecraft for Windows.

Download and run Code Connection.

Take the string that comes out of Code Connection and put it in the game (the example below is mine I just got out of the game, yours will look different).

/connect 199.254.146.175:19131

See here for how to start Code Connection and Minecraft
